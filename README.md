# How to play/install the mod
Make sure to use [GZDoom](https://zdoom.org/downloads) and have a copy of Doom2.wad (distribution of this one is illegal).  
Click and drag chaves.pk3 on top of gzdoom.exe.  
Make sure to check the checkbox that says Extra Graphics - Lights in order to load lights.pk3 inside GZDoom. The game gets too dark without it.

## Software used (were updated as I wrote this list):
### SLADE 3.2.1

Allows for file editing such as textures.

### Ultimate Doom Builder R4015 (64-bit)

Creates maps.

# Things that need to be done:
[Trello board](https://trello.com/b/zAKgRyzS/doom-chaves)

# Files
DECORATE.TXT - Actor definition, includes weapons, monsters, and player info.

GAMEINFO.TXT - Information used by GZDoom to boot up the game correctly.

SBARINFO.TXT - Draws the HUD in the game.

SNDINFO.TXT - Binds files to a variable name.

SNDSEQ.TXT - Sounds to be used for doors and platforms or in scripts.[^1]

MODELDEF.TXT - Definition for 3D models (exported in md3 format and png for textures), only work with OpenGL. Currently the only 3D models are objects in the map that seemed to complex to be achieved in 2D.

LOCKDEFS.TXT - Definition for literal locks in the game, which key opens them and what message is exibited onscreen.[^2]

MAPINFO.TXT - Game related info, such as what playerclass the player will use, what songs to use, what colors to use, can the player crouch or not, and also information about the maps the player will go through as well, and basic definitions on those maps.[^3]

ANIMDEFS.TXT - Animation definitions, such as how many ticks each picture will display, currently only used to display switched on TV screens.

TEXTURES - This file is auto-generated by slade and maps all textures.

/flats/ - Folder containing all textures related to floor or ceilings. In order to display properly, Slade needs to be configured to have Doom2.wad as it's base resource.

/graphics/ - Folder containing main screen graphics and text.

/music/ - Contains music files. It supports MP3, but it's heavy on the filesize.

/patches/ - Textures used for the walls, or anything else in the game that isn't a 3D model or floor/ceiling. The skybox is here too.

/sounds/ - Sound effects.

/sprites/ - Sprites for in-game graphics.

/sprites/models/ - Empty PNGs for the 3D models. Not exactly sure why these exist anymore.

## /maps/
map01.wad - Wad files are archives and the order inside these files matter! This file contains:

MAP01 - File for the actual map itself, it's lines which represents sectors (such as rooms or the illusory rooftops made using portals), and enemy/item/player placement. Can be edited in UDB.

TEXTMAP - Definition of all objects in the map. Automatically edited by UDB.

BEHAVIOR - Lump that contains a map's scripts in compiled form. SLADE can recompile these using acc. Remember to delete the old one.[^4]

DIALOGUE - Used for dialogue such as in Strife. Unused here. [Example](https://youtu.be/WjxJbo9jHFo?t=259)

ZNODES - Built automatically by UDB for UDMF format.

SCRIPTS - Map scripts, need to be recompiled after editing, and will replace BEHAVIOR when you do so.

ENDMAP - 0byte file that just represents the end of the archive.

# Original Description (in portuguese)
**O que é?**

Doom Chaves é um mod para o jogo Doom, criado por mim em 2014, quando eu estava nos meus 15 anos. Na época, devido a falta de conhecimento, e outros compromissos, eu acabei abandonando o mod em um estado extremamente inicial. Depois de tantos anos, eu acabei lembrando que ele existia, e recomecei a trabalhar nele. 

**Ainda não entendi que porcaria é essa...**

Você deve se lembrar do jogo Doom, febre nos anos 90. O que você provavelmente não deve saber é que existe uma comunidade que modifica o jogo até hoje, criando coisas que seriam inimagináveis em um jogo dessa época. Doom Chaves pega esse clássico jogo e adiciona características do Chaves no jogo.
